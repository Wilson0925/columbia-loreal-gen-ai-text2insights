This Capstone Project, generously sponsored by L'Oréal, sets out to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of various Large Language Models (LLMs) with a focus on their proficiency in Text2SQL tasks. (As a Text2SQL example problem is shown in figure 1) Our primary objective is to analyze these models based on key performance metrics, ease of implementation, and cost-effectiveness. Additionally, we will delve into other pertinent factors that influence the efficacy of these models in translating natural language text into SQL queries. A significant aspect of our approach includes the comparison and refinement of these models through strategic prompting engineering. This process is aimed at identifying the most efficient model for text-to-SQL conversions. The practical significance of our project lies in its potential business application: enabling companies to swiftly access and manipulate data from extensive databases. This capability is pivotal in enhancing data-driven decision-making processes in today's fast-paced business environments.
